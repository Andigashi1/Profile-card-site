## My process

The process of building this site wasn't hard although im sure that there are better ways to position the profile image and make the background more responsive. Will do my research and update it after.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that you can put more than one background image and learned to make use of that.

### Continued development

I want to continue studying and mastering html&css as much as i can and move to javascript after. I will be learning anything i need in order to get a job as a front-end developer.
